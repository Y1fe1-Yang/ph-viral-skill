## ❌ Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

Based on failed posts with only 1-3 comments:

| ❌ Don't Do | ✅ Do Instead | Result |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| "We just shipped v2.5!" | "Why [problem] keeps happening (and our fix)" | 2 comments → 168 comments |
| "Looking for beta testers" | "What if [pain point]? (We built [X], need 20 testers)" | 1 comment → 168 comments |
| "Let us know what you think!" | "I'd love to hear: [3 specific questions]" | Low engagement → High engagement |
| "Thanks for sharing!" | "Thanks! Quick question: [detail]? I'm wondering if..." | Conversation stops → Multiple rounds |

## 📈 Example: Technical Depth Post

### Input
```
"Generate a technical depth post for HappyCapy about AI context management"
```

### Output
```markdown
Title: What if your AI tools didn't forget everything between sessions?

Body:
If you switch between ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor daily, you've probably felt this:

You start a new tool and immediately have to:
- re-upload the same project files
- re-explain your coding style preferences
- repeat instructions you gave yesterday
- manually sync context across tools

Not because the tools are bad.
Because they don't talk to each other.

That's what pushed us to build HappyCapy Workspaces.

HappyCapy is a skill marketplace where context lives with your workspace,
not inside individual chat sessions.

What that means in practice:
- Upload files once → all skills can access them
- Set preferences once → every skill remembers
- Skills share outputs automatically
- Context persists across days, not just sessions

This started as a personal frustration after spending 30 minutes every morning
"warming up" ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor with the same context.

I'd genuinely love to hear from other builders here:
- How do you manage context across different AI tools today?
- What's the most frustrating thing about switching tools?
- If AI tools could share one thing perfectly, what should it be?

I'll be active in the comments — happy to talk about our technical decisions,
tradeoffs, and what we're still figuring out.

### Plus Timeline Strategy
